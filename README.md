ShakirMongoCatalog
==================

CMPE 226 Mongo DB Assignment.

This project is part of an assignment in the course - CMPE 226 in San Jose State University towards fulfilling the requirements of Masters in Software Engineering. 

This assignment is an implementation of a Appliance Catalog Webapp based on MongoDB datastore. I have used JSP pages to render UI while connecting to local MongoDB datastore that stores products in JSON documents. I have also implemented a search functionality using ElasticSearch and Kibana dashboard. Kibana dashboard has been embedded in the Webapp as a separate JSP.

Note: Do note that Kibana search uses the data from ElasticSearch database, hence I am "manually" replicating the data between MongoDB and ElasticSearch.

To use the Search page in my webapp, you will have to download and install ElasticSearch and Kibana. 

For implementation details and screenshots, refer to the ShakirMongoCatalog Implementation.docx file.

I have also added a saved Dashboard file for Kibana - Appliance Catalog Search-1400624535777. You can load this file from the Kibana dashboard.
